# NFL 4th Quarter Time Management Analyzer

**Live App**: [Coming Soon - Deploy URL Here]

Tells NFL offensive coordinators the exact decision they SHOULD make in any 4th quarter situation to maximize win probability. Analyzes game context (score, time, field position) and recommends RUN, PASS, PUNT, FIELD GOAL, EXTRA POINT, or GO FOR 2 with clear explanations of clock impact and strategic reasoning. Focuses exclusively on offensive decision-making. Built with Python, Streamlit, nflreadpy, Supabase, and hosted on Render.


**Core Philosophy**: When leading, kill clock with smart decisions. When trailing, preserve time and score quickly.
